### Exercise 7.14

Does the following statement always compute the fractional part of `f` correctly (assuming that `f` and frac_part are float variables)?

```c
frac_part = f - (int) f;
```
If not, what’s the problem?

### Solution

No. Converting `f` to int will fail if the value stored in `f` exceeds the largest value of type int.
